# Welcome to JDrupes Builder

JDrupes Builder ("jdbld" for short) is a
[build automation tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_system_(software_development))
that uses Java for its configuration and centers around resources.

Here's the source code for a sample build configuration, which will be explained
in more detail below:

```java
public class SimpleAppBuilder extends AbstractProject {

    public SimpleAppBuilder() {
        super(name("simple-app"));
        generator(JavaCompiler::new).addSources(Path.of("src"), "**/*.java");
        generator(AppJarGenerator::new).add(this).mainClass("jdbld.demo.simpleapp.App");
    }
}
```

In jdbld's terminology, a build system is a provider of resources.
It is implemented as a graph of
[ResourceProvider](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/api/ResourceProvider)s,
which provide [Resource](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/api/Resource)s in
response to
[ResourceRequest](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/api/ResourceRequest)s. The
topmost layer of the build system's configuration is a collection of
classes that implement the special resource provider
[Project](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/api/Project). Projects provide
resources by requesting them from other
[ResourceProvider](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/api/)s.

## Single project builds

In a single project build configuration, an instance of the defined
project class provides all resources by requesting them from its 
[Generator](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/api/Generator)s, which are
another special kind of
[ResourceProvider](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/api/ResourceProvider)s.

![Single project classes](javadoc/single-project-classes.svg)

A build configuration (a.k.a project) for a simple Java application
is shown below. It shows the objects that are generated by the source
code for the sample build configuration from above.

![Simple app jar project](javadoc/simple-appjar-project.svg)

The project contains two generators. The first is a
[JavaCompiler](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/java/JavaCompiler), which
provides resources of type
[ClassTree](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/java/ClassTree) to the project.
The second generator is an
[UberJarGenerator](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/java/UberJarGenerator).
This generator provides resources of type
[AppJarFile](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/java/AppJarFile). It uses the
[ClasspathElement](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/java/ClasspathElement)s
provided by the project as source for the jar's content.

You might wonder why the app jar generator goes back to the project
to retrieve the classpath elements. Looking at the API, we could also have
the app jar generator reference the Java compiler directly. There are two
reasons for this. First, a user might want to request the class tree from
the project (instead of the application jar) for whatever purpose. The
second reason will become clear when we discuss a multi-project build
configuration, in which a project can provide resources from another project
in addition to those obtained from its generators.

For further clarification, the diagram below shows the sequence of operations
as they happen when a user requests the application jar from the project.

## Resource requests

Resources are usually requested by type rather than by name.
Therefore we need a consistent way to define resource types
for queries. Let's use the Java class path as an example. A Java
class path consist of elements. These elements can be jar files
or trees of class files (which are denoted in the class path by their
root directory).

Using [ClasspathElement](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/api/ClasspathElement)
as common supertype for jar files and class trees, we could ask for the
resource type
[ClasspathElement](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/api/ClasspathElement).
But actually, we cannot expect to get a single classpath element back.
Instead, we should expect to get a collection of classpath elements. So
it makes more sense to ask for a collection of classpath elements, which
makes the requested type `Resources<ClasspathElement>`.

![Java base types](javadoc/java-base-types.svg)

There is one more point to consider. There can be different kinds of
classpaths such as a compile time and a runtime classpath. Both are 
collections of
[ClasspathElement](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/api/ClasspathElement)s.
However, depending on the kind of classpath, a
[ResourceProvider](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/api/) may deliver different
subsets of classpath elements. We can include this information in the
resource type by using a specialized container whose type indicates
the desired subset of instances. For Java classpaths, the specialized
container types are
[CompilationResources](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/api/CompilationResources)
and [RuntimeResources](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/api/RuntimeResources).

From this example, we derive the common pattern for resource requests.

 1. The requested type is always a collection of resources, i.e.
    [Resources](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/api/Resources) or a type
    derived from it.
 2. The type of the elements in the container is the type of the
    resource instances returned as Java `Stream` by the 
    [ResourceProvider](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/api/ResourceProvider)'s
    [provide](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/api/ResourceProvider#provide)
    method.
 3. The type of the container may be used by providers to select
    the instances they want to provide.

The available resource types and the effect that the type of the
container has on the provided resources can be found in the
documentation of the respective providers.

A commonly available resource that must be supported by all providers
that generate resources is 
"[Cleanliness](javadoc/org/jdrupes/builder/api/Cleanliness)".
Admittedly, this is pushing the concept of everything being a resource
to its limits. It solves the problem of cleaning up after a build.
Depending on your point of view, "cleanliness" may be the absence of
something, but you could also argue that "cleanliness" is something
that can be provided.
