# JDrupes Builder

A builder that focuses on resources and uses Java for its configuration.

The focus on resources usually works. It fails when you want
the builder to do something that cannot really be described as the
creation of a resource. Maybe the most prominent example of this is
cleaning a build. What does this provide? Well, how about "cleanliness"?
Depending on your point of view, "cleanliness" may be the absence of
something, but you could also argue that it provides something.
